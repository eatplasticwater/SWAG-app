          <p>Snow and weather observations represent a series of meteorological
            and snow surface measurements taken at a properly
            instrumented study plot or in the field (refer to <a href=\"#placeholder\">Appendix D<\/a>).
            Observational data taken at regular intervals provide the basis
            for recognizing changes in stability of the snow cover and for
            reporting weather conditions to a meteorological office or
            regional avalanche center.<\/p>

            <p>Sustained long-term data sets of snow and weather observations
              can be used to improve avalanche hazard forecasts by
              statistical and numerical techniques. These data sets also serve
              to increase climatic knowledge of an area. Observations should
              be complete, accurate, recorded in a uniform manner, and made
              routinely. Following an established protocol increases the consistency
              in the data record, reduces error, and increases the potential
              for useful interpretation of the data.<\/p>
