    <p>Snow profiles are observed at study plots, study slopes, fracture lines and targeted sites. This section outlines two types of snow profiles: full profiles and test profiles. A full profile is a complete record of snow-cover stratigraphy and characteristics of individual layers. A test profile is a record of selected observations.</p>
    <h3 id="full-profile">Full Profiles</h3>
    <p>Full snow profiles (<a href="#figure2-2Accordion">Figure 2.2</a>) are frequently observed at study plots or study slopes in time series to track changes in the snowpack. They require that all, or most, snowpack variables be measured (<a href="#placeholder">Section 2.5</a>). Full profiles are time-consuming and not always possible at targeted sites.</p>

    <h3 id="test-profile">Test Profiles</h3>
    <p>Test profiles (<a href="#figure2-2Accordion">Figure 2.2</a>) are the most common type of snow profile. There is no fixed rule about the type and amount of information collected in a test profile. Each observer must select, observe, and record the parameters needed by their operation. These parameters may change in both time and space. Test profiles are commonly observed at targeted sites and fracture lines.</p>
    <p>The objectives of observing full profiles are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Identify the layers of the snowpack</li>
      <li>Identify the hardness and/or density of the layers in
        the snowpack</li>
      <li>Identify weak interfaces between layers and to approximate
        their stability</li>
      <li>Observe snow temperatures</li>
      <li>Monitor and confirm changes in snowpack stability</li>
      <li>Determine the thickness of a potential slab avalanche</li>
      <li>Determine the state of metamorphism in different snow layers</li>
      <li>Observe and record temporal and spatial changes in
        snow properties</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A test profile addresses one or more of the above objectives. In addition, this information can be used for climatological studies, forecasts of snowmelt runoff, engineering applications, and studies of the effect of snow on vegetation and wildlife.</p>
    
    <h3 id="typical-full-profile">Typical Full Profile</h3>
    <p>A typical full profile may include the following observations:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Temperature by depth (<a href="#placeholder">Section 2.5.1</a>)</li>
      <li>Identification of layer boundaries (<a href="#placeholder">Section 2.5.2</a>)</li>

    <h2 id="2-4-1">2.4.1 Location</h2>
    <p>Snow profiles can be observed at a variety of locations depending on the type of information desired. Typical locations include study plots, study slopes, fracture lines, or targeted sites. Full profiles are usually conducted at study plots, study slopes, and fracture lines; however, full profiles and test profiles can be completed at any location.</p>
    <h3 id="study-plot">Study Plot</h3>
    <p>Study plots are used to observe and record parameters for a longterm record. They are fixed locations that are carefully chosen to minimize contamination of the observations by external forces such as wind, solar radiation, slope angle, and human activity (<a href="#placeholder">See Appendix D</a>). Study plots are typically flat sites and can be co-located with a meteorological observing station.</p>
    <p>Observations are carried out at a study plot by excavating each snow pit progressively in a line marked with two poles. Subsequent observation pits should be at a distance about equal to the total snow depth, but at least 1 m from the previous one. After each observation, the extreme edge of the pit is marked with a pole to indicate where to dig the next pit (i.e. at least 1 m from that point). When the observations are complete, the snow pit should be refilled with snow to minimize atmospheric influences on lower snowpack layers.</p>
    <p>Study plots and study slopes should be selected and marked before the winter and the ground between the marker poles cleared of brush and large rocks. Some operations will require multiple study plots to adequately track snowpack conditions.</p>
    <h3 id="study-slope">Study Slope</h3>
    <p>The best snow stability information is obtained from snow profiles observed in avalanche starting zones. Since starting zones are not always safely accessible, other slopes can be selected that are reasonably representative of individual or a series of starting zones. Choosing a safe location for a study slope is critical. The study slope should be relatively uniform in aspect and slope angle, and with the exception of the observations, should remain undisturbed during the winter. The study slope may be preselected and marked in the same manner as study plots; however, marker poles on slopes will be tilted by snow creep and may have to be periodically reset. Some operations may find it advantageous to collect their time series observations on a study slope in addition to, or in place of, a study plot. Multiple study slopes may be useful.</p>
    <h3 id="fracture-line">Fracture Line</h3>
    <p>Observing snow profiles (<a href="#figure2-2bAccordion">Figure 2.2</a>) near an avalanche fracture line can provide valuable information about the cause of the slide. Safety considerations are paramount when selecting a site for a profile. Before approaching a site, observers must evaluate the potential for and consequences of further releases.</p>

    <p>Snow profiles can be observed on a crown face or flank as well as areas where the weak layer did not fracture (<a href="#figure2-3Accordion">Figure 2.3</a>). When possible, profiles should be observed at a fracture line and at least 1.5 m away from the crown face or flank in undisturbed snow.</p>
    <p>Fracture line profiles should be observed at as many locations as possible (<a href="#figure2-3Accordion">Figure 2.3</a>), including thick and thin sections of the fracture line. In addition, use a sketch or camera to document the location of prominent features and location of fracture line profiles. Carefully note terrain, vegetation, solar, and wind effects on the snowpack. Note any evidence of past avalanche activity which may have influenced the structure of the snowpack.</p>
   <p>The snow that remains following an avalanche can be either stronger than what slid or dangerously weak. Care should also be taken to choose a location where average crown depth is not exceeded. It is preferable to examine the snow along a fracture line at as many places as possible as time allows.</p>

   <h3 > Targeted Site</h3>
   <p>A targeted site (<a href="#figure2-4Accordion">Figure 2.4</a>) is selected to satisfy a particular observer's objectives. The site should be selected to target parameters of interest. Keep in mind that exposure to wind, solar radiation, elevation, and other factors produce variations in snowpack characteristics.</p>
   <p>General rules for choosing a targeted site include:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Always evaluate the safety of a location prior to performing a snow profile.</li>
     <li>To minimize the effects of trees, dig the snow pit no closer
       to trees than the height of the nearest tree (draw an imaginary line from the top of the tree at a 45 degree angle to the snow surface). In high-traffic areas, or when evaluating forested slopes, this criterion may not be practical.</li>
     <li>Avoid depressions such as gullies or other terrain traps.</li>
     <li>Avoid heavily compacted areas such as tree wells, canopy
       sluffs, and tracks made by humans or other animals.</li>
     <li>Avoid significantly wind-affected areas (scoured or loaded) not representative of targeted snow layering.</li>
     <li>Avoid areas with buried trees, bushes, or large rocks.</li>

    <h2 id="2-4-2">2.4.2 Frequency of Observations</h2>
    <p>No firm rules can be set on how frequently snow profiles should be observed. Frequency is dependent on climate, terrain, access to starting zones, recent weather, current snow stability, type of avalanche operation, and other considerations. Full profiles should be conducted at regular intervals at study plots and study slopes. Profiles at fracture lines and targeted sites can be completed on an as-needed basis.</p>

    <h2 id="2-4-4">2.4.4 Field Procedure</h2>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>Equipment used to measure or observe snow properties should be kept in the shade and/or cooled in the snow prior to use. Observers should wear gloves to reduce thermal contamination of measurements.</p>
    <h3>Checking Snow Depth</h3>
    <p>Check the snow depth with a probe before digging the observation pit and make sure the pit is not on top of a boulder, bush or in a depression. Careful probing can also be used to obtain a first indication of snow layering. Probing prior to digging is not necessary in a study plot, or when the snow is much deeper than your probe.</p>
    <h3>Digging the Snow Pit</h3>
    <p>Make the hole wide enough to facilitate all necessary observations and to allow shoveling at the bottom. Remember to examine the snow as you dig the pit as valuable information can be obtained during this process. In snow deeper than 2 m it may be advantageous to dig first to a depth of about 1.5 m, make the observations (such as stability tests) and then complete excavation and observations to the necessary depth. The pit face on which the snow is to be observed should be in the shade. Cut the observation face in an adjacent sidewall vertical and smooth. On inclined terrain it is advantageous to make the observations on a shaded sidewall that is parallel to the fall line. Consider piling the debris on the downhill edge and sides to facilitate filling in the snow pit (<a href="#placeholder">Section 2.5.8</a>).</p>
    
    <h3>Recording</h3>
    
    <p>If there are two observers, the first observer can prepare the pit, while the second observer begins the observations (see <a href="#figure2-7Accordion">Figures 2.7</a> and <a href="#figure2-9Accordion">2.9</a> for examples of field notes):</p>
