          <p>Accumulated precipitation gauges collect snowfall, rainfall and other forms of precipitation and continuously record their water equivalent. There are a variety of commercial gauges (both manual and automated) available.<\/p>
          <h3>Procedure<\/h3>
          <p>Record the amount of precipitation accumulated in the recording precipitation gauge to the nearest tenth of a millimeter (0.1 mm) or 0.01 of an inch. The amount of precipitation that fell during a single event can be obtained by taking the difference between the present reading and the previous reading.<\/p>
