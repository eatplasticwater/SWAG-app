          <p>The new snow measurement in the standard morning observation uses a 24-hour interval. Many operations will find it useful to observe snowfall on more than one interval. However, the 24-hour interval snow board should only be used for 24-hour observations. Additional snow boards should be added for additional observations as necessary. It is highly recommended that both 24-hour and Storm intervals be observed by operations that maintain a study plot. Other commonly used intervals appear in the Snow Board Naming Convention <a href=\"#placeholder\">Section 1.21.1<\/a>.<\/p>

          <p>New snow measurements should be made on a snow board (<a href=\"#figure1-3Accordion\">Figure 1.3<\/a>). The base plate should have minimum dimensions of 40 cm x 40 cm (or 15 in x 15 in), with an attached rod of 1 m (or 3 ft) in length. Larger boards (60 cm x 60 cm) provide more room to make measurements. The base plate and rod should be painted white to reduce the effects of solar heating.<\/p>
          
          <h3>Procedure<\/h3>
          <p>Use a ruler graduated in centimeters (or inches) to measure the depth of snow accumulated on the snow board. Take measurements in several spots on the board. Calculate the average of the measurements and record to the nearest cm (in). Record \"T\" (signifying a trace) when the depth is less than 1 cm (or 0.5 in), or when snow fell but did not accumulate. If there is no new snow, record zero. Do not consider surface hoar on the boards as snowfall; clear off hoar layer after observation. If both rain and snow fell, it should be noted in the remarks.<\/p>
          <p>The sample on the snow board can also be used to measure the water equivalent of new snow (<a href=\"#placeholder\">Section 1.22<\/a>). Once the observations are complete, redeposit the snow in the depression left by the snow board, adding additional snow if necessary to reposition the board level with the surrounding snow surface.<\/p>
          <p>If the snow board was not level, the measurement should be made normal to the surface of the board.<\/p>
