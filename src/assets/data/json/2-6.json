          <p>Many of the stability tests described in the following sections yield some indication of the load required to produce a fracture. Fracture is the process of crack propagation. In addition to the magnitude of the load, observing the nature of the fracture can improve estimations of snow stability and can, in particular, reduce false-stable results (Johnson and Birkeland, 1998; Birkeland and Johnson, 1999; Johnson and Birkeland, 2002; Birkeland and Johnson, 2003; van Herwijnen and Jamieson, 2002; van Herwijnen, 2003). Both methods described below may be included with the results of a column or block test (see <a href=\"#placeholder\">Section 2.7<\/a>) and provide additional information about the stability of the snow slope. All the research with these methods has been conducted using compression-type tests such as the compression, stuffblock, and Rutschblock Tests.<\/p>
          <p>The methods described in this section provide a qualitative assessment of the fracture (crack propagation) potential. Although the definitions and approach differ, the phenomena they describe are essentially identical (<a href=\"#table2-6Accordion\">Table 2.6<\/a>). Both methods require experienced observers to make somewhat subjective assessments, especially when trying to determine whether a planar fracture is sudden (SP\/Q1) or resistant (RP\/Q2). Members of an operational program should select the method that works best for their application and periodically compare their ratings to ensure consistency.<\/p>

          <hr>
          <h2 id=\"2-6-2\">2.6.2 Fracture Character<\/h2>
          <p>Fracture Character was developed by the Applied Snow and Avalanche Research Group at the University of Calgary to assess fracture (crack propagation) potential. It can be used with many of the stability tests in this chapter and other tests that load a small column of snow until a fracture appears, but is not recommended for use with the Extended Column Test and Propagation Saw Test.<\/p>
          <p>Fracture character is best observed in tests performed on a small isolated column of snow where the objective is to load the column until it fractures, or fails to fracture. The front face and side walls of the test column should be as smooth as possible. The observer should be positioned in such a way that one side wall and the entire front face of the test column can be observed.Attention should be focused on weak layers or interfaces identified in a profile or previous snowpack.<\/p>
          <h3>Procedure<\/h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Conduct a stability test.<\/li>
            <li>Carefully observe how the fracture occurs in the target
              weak layer. For tests on low-angled terrain that produced planar fractures, it may be useful to slide the two shear surfaces across one another by carefully grasping the two sides of the block and pulling while noting the resistance.<\/li>
