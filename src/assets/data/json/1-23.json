          <p>Density is a measure of mass per unit volume; density is expressed in SI units of kg\/m3. It is also common for avalanche operations to discuss snow density in percent water content per volume. Calculations of both quantities are described below. Data records of snow density should be recorded in units of kg\/m<sup>3<\/sup>. The Greek symbol <i>&rho;<\/i> (rho) is used to represent density.<\/p>
          
          <h3>Calculating Density<\/h3>
          <p>Divide the mass (g) of new snow by the sample volume (cm3) and multiply by 1000 to express the result in kilograms per cubic meter (kg\/m3). Record as a whole number (i.e. 120 kg\/m<sup>3<\/sup>).<\/p>

          <p>The density of a snow sample is often communicated as a
            dimensionless ratio or percent. Calculate this ratio by dividing the height of the water in a snow layer by the height of the snow layer and then multiply by 100 (e.g. 10 cm of snow that contains 1 cm of water has a water content of 10%). This ratio can also be calculated by dividing the density of the snow (kg\/ m<sup>3<\/sup>) by the density of water (1000 kg\/m3) and multiplying by one hundred. Using the density of water allows for an easy calculation by moving the decimal one space to the left (i.e. 80 kg\/m<sup>3<\/sup> = 8%).<\/p>
