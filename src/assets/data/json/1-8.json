          <p>Heli-ski guiding, ski touring and similar operations often observe general weather conditions in the field. These observations may serve as an interval measurement, accompany a snow profile, or serve to document conditions across a portion of their operational area. The records should describe some of the parameters listed in this section, but field reports should be made as a series of comments so as not to be confused with observations taken at a fixed weather station. Maximum and minimum temperatures cannot be observed, but a range in present temperatures can be reported. Field observations should specify the elevation range and the time, or time range, from where the observations were taken. Common field observations typically include: time, location, elevation, sky cover, wind speed and direction, air temperature and precipitation type and rate. Field weather observations that are estimates and not measurements should be recorded with a tilde (&Tilde;) to denote that the value is approximate.<\/p>
