          <p>Observations and records of avalanche occurrences have the following applications:<\/p>
          <ul>
            <li>Information about avalanche occurrences and non-occurrences is used in association with other observations in evaluating snow stability.<\/li>
            <li>Observations identify areas where avalanches released earlier in the winter or storm\/avalanche cycle. Snow stability may vary between these sites and nearby undisturbed slopes.<\/li>
            <li>Avalanche observation data are essential when protective works and facilities are planned, when the effectiveness of mitigation measures is assessed, and when forecasting models are developed by correlating past weather and snow conditions with avalanche occurrences.<\/li>
            <li>Understanding the avalanche phenomenon through research.<\/li>
          <\/ul>
          <p>All avalanches that are significant to an operation should be recorded. Noting the non-occurrence of avalanches is also important for snow stability evaluation and during hazard reduction missions.<\/p>
