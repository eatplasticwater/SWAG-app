          <h2 id="H-1">H.1 Objective</h2>
          <p>The objective of reporting avalanche accidents and damage is to collect data about the extent of avalanche hazards in the United States. Summaries of the reports will draw attention to avalanche problems and assist in the development of risk reduction measures.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2 id="H-2">H.2 Reporting Forms</h2>
          <p>Two different reports are available for recording avalanche accidents and damage. Any person who wishes to report an avalanche incident or accident can use these reports.</p>
          <p>The short form is a brief summary of an avalanche incident or accident. This form should be submitted every time people are involved in an avalanche, property is damaged or a significant natural event occurs.</p>
          <p>The long form is a detailed report that can be used as a template for an accident investigation. This report should be completed when an avalanche causes a fatality, serious injury, or property damage in excess of $5,000, or when the incident has a high educational value. It may be useful as a checklist when operations wish to describe an accident and rescue work in greater detail. Copies of these forms are available at <a href="https://www.americanavalancheassociation.org/swag." target="_blank">americanavalancheassociation.org</a>.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2 id="H-3">H.3 Filing of Reports</h2>
          <p>Completed short reports should be returned as quickly as possible to the nearest avalanche center. A copy should also be sent to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center, which serves as a central recording hub for avalanche accident information.</p>

          <p>Reports will be used to identify trends in avalanche accidents, used for educational purposes, and to maintain long-term data sets. The reporter’s and victim’s names and contact information should be recorded. Requests for anonymity will be noted and respected whenever possible.</p>

        <h2 id="H-4">H.4 Completing the Short Form</h2>
          <p>Avalanche conditions within a forecast area can be separated based on terrain or snowpack characteristics.</p>
          Specify the area based on:<br>
          <h3>H.4.1 Date and Time</h3>
          <p>Fill in the date and time of the avalanche occurrence.</p>
          <h3>H.4.2 Location</h3>
          <p>Give the mountain range, valley and feature where the avalanche occurred. Include as much information as possible including county name, ski area name, highway name, avalanche path and GPS coordinates.</p>
          <h3>H.4.3 Group and Activity Description</h3>
          <p>Record the primary purpose of the group when the avalanche occurred. Enter the number of people engaged in each listed activity. If the activity is not listed write it in (i.e. mountain climbing, snowshoeing, traveling on a road). Note if the group was ascending, descending, etc.</p>
          <h3>H.4.4 People Caught in the Avalanche</h3>
          <p>Enter the number of people that were involved in the avalanche and the number injured or killed. Of those involved, give the number that were not caught or buried; the number caught; the number that were partially buried–not critical; the number that were partially buried–critical; and the number completely buried using the definitions listed below.</p>
          <p>The following definitions were composed for the purpose of reporting incidents and accidents with the intent of delineating between different rescue scenarios.</p>
          <p>A person is caught if they are touched and adversely affected by the avalanche. People performing slope cuts are generally not considered caught in the resulting avalanche unless they are carried down the slope.</p>
          <p><strong>A person is partially buried–not critical</strong> if their head is above the snow surface when the avalanche stops.</p>
          <p><strong>A person is partially buried–critical</strong> if their head is below the snow surface when the avalanche stops but equipment, clothing and/or portions of their body are visible.</p>
          <p><strong>A person is completely buried</strong> if they are completely beneath the snow surface when the avalanche stops. Clothing and attached equipment are not visible on the surface.</p>
          <p>For people that were completely buried or partially buried– critical, estimate the length of time they were buried, the burial depth measured from the snow surface to their face, position of person (face-up, face-down, or sitting), the distance between multiple persons and distance from vehicle if applicable. Include the method of rescue used to find the victim (i.e. transceiver, exposed equipment, exposed body part, spot probe, probe line, voice, etc.).</p>
          <h3>H.4.5 Diagram</h3>
          <p>Provide a sketch, photograph, or digital image showing the out- line of the avalanche, the deposit, and the locations of people, snowmobiles, and other equipment when the avalanche started and when it stopped. Include significant terrain features and avalanche path characteristics such as starting zones or terrain traps.</p>
          <h3>H.4.6 Avalanche Description</h3>
          <p>Fill in the appropriate fields as accurately as possible.</p>
          <h3>H.4.7 Comments</h3>
          <p>Briefly describe: events leading to the avalanche involvement; how the rescue was conducted; the injuries sustained; level of avalanche training of group members; and other information that may be significant. A description of the events and decision-making process leading up to the accident should be recorded.</p>

          <h2 id="H-5">H.5 Completing the Detailed Report</h2>
          <p>On the form enter the information in the spaces provided or tick off the multiple-choice statements.</p>
          <p>Write "N/Av" if the information is not available or "N/App" if not applicable. Online versions of these forms can be found at <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/avalanche" target="_blank">colorado.gov</a>.</p>
