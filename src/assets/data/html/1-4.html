            <p>Manual observations can be used to maintain a long-term record and
            observe and record data not amenable to sensing by automated
            systems. Automated observations provide unattended continuous
            weather (and some snowpack) information about a certain
            region or regions within a forecast or ski area. Automated
            weather stations can be co-located at study sites where manual
            weather observations and/or snowpack observations are collected.
            Programs that maintain a study plot should use data from
            automated weather stations to augment and not replace manual
            observations. The following chapter discusses how to make and
            record manual observations. Details regarding automated snow
            and weather observations appear in <a href="/swag-content/5-5">Appendix E</a>.</p>
