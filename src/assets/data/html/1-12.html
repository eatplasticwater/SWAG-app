          <h3>Valley Fog/Cloud</h3>
          <p>Where valley fog or valley cloud exists below the observation site, estimate the elevation of the top and bottom of the fog layer in feet (meters) above sea level. Give the elevation to the nearest 100 ft (or 50 m). Data code: VF.</p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> Clear sky with valley fog from 7,500 to 9,000 ft is coded as CLR VF 7500-9000.</p>
          <h3>Thin Cloud</h3>
          <p>The amount of cloud, not the opacity, is the primary classification criterion. Thin cloud has minimal opacity, such that the disk of the sun would still be clearly visible through the clouds if they were between the observer and the sun, and shadows would still be cast on the ground. When the sky condition features a thin scattered, broken or overcast cloud layer then precede the symbol with a dash.</p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> A sky completely covered with thin clouds is coded as &ndash; OVC.</p>
