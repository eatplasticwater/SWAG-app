          <p>There are many good and different methods for taking field notes. Following these general practices will ensure that quality data are collected.</p>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li>Do not leave blanks. If a value was not observed, record N/O for not observed or place a dash (&ndash;) in the cell of a standard form where a particular observation is missing or never observed.</li>
            <li>Only write "0" when the reading is zero, for example, when no new snow has accumulated on the new snow board.</li>
            <li>Only record values that are actually observed.</li>
          </ul>
      </main>
