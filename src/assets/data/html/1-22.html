          <p>The water equivalent is the depth of the layer of water that would form if the snow on the board melted. It is equal to the amount of liquid precipitation. The standard morning observation includes the water equivalent of the new snow on a 24-hour interval. The same snow board used for a 24-hour or other interval measurement should be used to calculate the water equivalent. There are several suitable methods for making this measurement. Three different methods are described in the following section.</p>
          
          <h3>Procedure</h3>
          <p>Use one of the following methods to calculate the water equivalent of the new snow. Record the value to the nearest 0.1 mm (or 0.01 in). Make several measurements and report the average value. Record "T" (signifying a trace) when the snow depth is less than 1 cm (or 0.5 in). If there is no new snow, record a zero. Do not consider surface hoar on the boards as snowfall; clear off hoar layer after observation.</p>

            <h3>Melting the Snow Sample</h3>
            <p>The water equivalent of the new snow can be obtained by melting a sample of snow and measuring the resulting amount of melt water. The height of the melt water in mm (in) is the water equivalent of the sample. When using this method, the base area of the snow sample and the melted sample must remain the same.</p>   
            
            <h3 id ="indirect">Indirect Method</h3>
            <p>The water equivalent of snow can also be obtained by weighing a snow sample of known cross-sectional area. Water equivalent is calculated by using the following equation:</p>  
            
            <img src="/assets/images/figures/1-22.svg" alt="Formula for Water Equivalent" class="image-fluid formula-img">
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This method is commonly used by avalanche operations because of its ease (Note: 1 cm3 of water has a mass of 1 g). The expanded equation is in <a href="/swag-content/5-2">Appendix B</a>, Section B.5.</p>
