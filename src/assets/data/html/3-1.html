          <p>Observations of past and present avalanche activity are of the utmost importance for any avalanche forecasting operation. These data should be recorded and organized in a manner that allows personnel to visualize temporal and spatial patterns in recent avalanche activity. Objectives for observing avalanches are presented in <a href="/swag-content/3-2">Section 3.2</a>. A standard avalanche observation is presented in <a href="/swag-content/3-4">Section 3.4</a>. The remainder of this chapter provides methods for observing a wide variety of avalanche related phenomena. Parameters are divided into avalanche path characteristics and avalanche event characteristics. Parameters in the standard avalanche observation are marked with a <img src="/assets/images/icons/snow.svg" alt="Icon: Standard Observation" class="icon-sm"> symbol.
          </p>
          <p>Individual operations can choose to observe and record parameters beyond those included in the standard observation. The parameters collected will depend on the type of operation and the snow climate of the forecast area.</p>
