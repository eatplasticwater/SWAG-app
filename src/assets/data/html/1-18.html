          <p>An indication of the snowpack's ability to support a given load and a relative measure of snow available for wind transport can be gained from surface penetrability measurements. There are several common methods for examining surface penetration. Ram penetration is the preferred method of observation because it produces more consistent results than ski or foot penetration. When performing foot or ski penetration on an incline, average the uphill and downhill depths of the track.</p>
