          <h2 id="1-2">Preface</h2>
          <p>In 2004, the American Avalanche Association, in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service National Avalanche Center, published the inaugural edition of Snow, Weather, and Avalanches: Observation Guidelines for Avalanche Programs in the United States. Producing that inaugural volume of what has affectionately become known as SWAG was an arduous process taking several years, numerous individuals, and many organizations working to find common ground. In the end, the guidelines reflected our community’s best effort at merging the Westwide data standards (which had been widely used in the United States since 1968) and the guidelines published by our friends north of the border at the Canadian Avalanche Association. The CAA generously offered their guidelines as a template for ours in the hopes that our two avalanche communities could eventually move toward a common document.</p>
          <p>Despite our initial trepidation, SWAG gained almost immediate acceptance by the U.S. avalanche community and was also adopted by avalanche workers in many other countries. It is now an integral part of operations, handed out in avalanche classes and found in patrol rooms and on the desks of forecasters around the country. Indeed, a new generation of U.S. avalanche workers have started careers and assumed leadership roles since SWAG’s initial release.</p>
          <p>SWAG aims to capture the techniques and tools currently used by U.S. avalanche programs. Since these tools are constantly evolving, so too must this document. This is the 4th edition, and the SWAG revision team aimed for primarily minor changes. Even so, it was a heavy lift and the revision team cleaned up language, modernized terminology, and clarified some sections throughout the document. Among the changes you will find are a better description of avalanche runout and alpha angles (<a href="/swag-content/3-6">Section 3.6.11</a>), a new data code for Propagation Saw Test results (<a href="/swag-content/2-7">Table 2.15</a>), and improved language in some column and block test sections (<a href="/swag-content/2-7">Sections 2.7.1</a>, <a href="/swag-content/2-7">2.7.3</a>, <a href="/swag-content/2-7">2.7.4</a>, <a href="/swag-content/2-7">2.7.6</a>, and <a href="/swag-content/2-7">2.7.7</a>). You will also see some additional language on estimating the relative size (R-size) of an avalanche in <a href="/swag-content/2-7">Section 3.6.5.2</a>. This is important because almost all U.S. avalanche observations prior to 2004 use the R-size scale. Applying this scale correctly and consistently today ensures continuity with our historic avalanche data, which is critical for researchers studying the effects of climate change on avalanche activity.</p>
          <p>The goal of SWAG remains unchanged. It is meant to be a professional reference that establishes common methods. This benefits every- one by both increasing the ease of communication between operations and by facilitating the development of long-term datasets that will provide insights into avalanche processes in the future. Clearly, there is not one set of tools or one set methodology that must be used for avalanche operations. Indeed, as the late Ed LaChapelle pointed out in a seminal paper over forty years ago, there is no single correct path to an accurate avalanche forecast. SWAG recognizes the unique nature of many avalanche programs and their special needs. It strives to provide the flexibility necessary for them to operate effectively while still providing a common language for all of us. Finally, this edition &mdash; like the previous ones &mdash; is not meant to inhibit creativity or innovation. We encourage experimentation and the development of new tests and methods by practitioners and scientists alike. It is a point of pride in our community that some innovations have come from Master's theses and Ph.D. dissertations, while others started with spirited discussions in a ski patrol shack.</p>
          <p>The U.S. avalanche community, through the good work of the American Avalanche Association, has produced four editions of SWAG over the past 18 years. With each one the contributor list has grown longer (see <a onclick="document.getElementById('1-3').scrollIntoView(true);">Acknowledgments</a>). The unsung hero behind these efforts is Ethan Greene, whose leadership, attention to detail, and commitment to excellence shines through each edition. The past two editions have also served as a way for us to bring on and mentor current industry leaders who have expressed interest in helping to push SWAG forward in the years to come. We believe the future of our avalanche community and the continued excellence of this document are in good hands.</p>

          <p>The observations and recording practices listed in this document were developed or implemented by the people working with avalanches in the United States, starting just after World War II and continuing until today. This work was not developed in isolation. Rather it evolved from the fruitful collaboration with scientists and practitioners in many parts of the world, including Canada, Europe, Scandinavia, and Asia. Whenever possible, the contents of this book attempt to align with international standards and standards set by other relevant disciplines.</p>
          <p>The seed of the first edition of <i>Snow, Weather, and Avalanches: Observation Guidelines for Avalanche Programs in the United States</i> (SWAG) was a publication of the Canadian Avalanche Association (CAA) entitled <i>Observational Guidelines and Recording Standards for Weather, Snowpack, and Avalanches </i>(OGRS). The CAA devoted a tremendous amount of time and money to creating and maintain- ing the OGRS document, which became a symbol of professional practice in North America. With the CAA’s support, the American Avalanche Association (A3) and the USDA Forest Service National Avalanche Center (NAC) provided structure and funding to collect practices from the United States and produce the first edition of SWAG in 2004. The document was revised in 2010, and again in 2016.</p>
          <p>The list of people that have contributed to the evolution of SWAG is getting quite long. The committee that produced the first version included Karl Birkeland, Kelly Elder, Greg Johnson, Chris Landry, Ian McCammon, Mark Moore, Don Sharaf, Craig Sterbenz, Bruce Tremper, Knox Williams, and myself. The original effort could not have been completed without the support of Clair Israelson, Janet Kellam, and Doug Abromeit. Dale Atkins and Brian Lazar joined the committee for the second edition, and Mark Staples and Doug Krause (as editor) for the third. For this edition, Simon Trautman and Wendy Wagner joined the team. In addition to all these people, I want to acknowledge the contribution of the following people to this growing body of work: Pat Ahern, Jon Andrews, Don Bachman, Ned Bair, Hal Boyne, Cam Campbell, Doug Chabot, Steve Conger, Mike Cooperstein, Jeff Deems, Nolan Doesken, Pascal Haegeli, Dave Hamre, Dave Gauthier, Bill Glude, Charles Fierz, Liam Fitzgerald, Bruce Jamieson, Ron Johnson, Chris Joosen, Dan Judd, Art Judson, Tom Kimbrough, Mark Kozak, Spencer Logan, Bill Lerch, Tom Leonard, Chris Lundy, Hans-Peter Marshall, Tom McKee, Art Mears, Peter Martinelli Jr., Rod Newcomb, Erich Peitzsch, Ron Perla, Nancy Pfeiffer, Scott Savage, Ron Simenhois, Grant Statham, Ian Tomm, and Joyce VanDeWater. Instructors and students from many venues have offered constructive criticism, which has improved the clarity and focus of the text. Many people provided images for this publication and they are listed with their contributions. Our community continues to contribute to and improve this work. I apologize to anyone that I forgot.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I would like to thank Jayne Nolan, Emma Walker, and McKenzie Long for their work on this version of SWAG, and the current members of the American Avalanche Association’s Observation Standards Committee for their dedication, patience, and the hard work they put into revising this document for the 4th edition.</p>

          <h2 id="1-4">Introduction</h2>
          <p>This document contains a set of guidelines for observing and
            recording snow, weather, and avalanche phenomena. These
            guidelines were prepared for avalanche forecasting operations,
            but can be applied to other programs as well. The guidelines are
            presented as a resource of common methods and are intended
            to promote efficient and fruitful communication among professional
            operations and between research and operational
            communities.</p>
            <p>The observations presented in this manual were selected to support
              active avalanche forecasting programs. Observing these
              parameters will help avalanche forecasters make informed and
              consistent decisions, provide current and accurate information,
              and document methods and rationale for operational decisions.
              Recording these parameters will assist program managers in
              documenting and analyzing unusual events, applying pattern
              recognition and statistical forecasting methods, and assisting
              research into snow and avalanche phenomena. In addition, there
              is often little snow and weather data collected in mountainous
              areas, and data collected by avalanche forecasting programs can
              be used in climatological and mountain systems research. Our
              hope is that this manual will help forecasters carefully choose the
              observations that support their programs, and that those observations
              will generate consistent, high-quality data sets.</p>
              <p>It is unlikely that any one operation will make all of the observations
                outlined within this document. Individual program
                managers should select a set of parameters that their staff can
                observe routinely. Programs with specialized needs may have to
                look elsewhere for information on additional observations. A set
                of references is listed in <a href="/swag-content/5-1">Appendix A</a> as a starting point.</p>

          <h3>Structure of This Manual</h3>
          <p>This manual is divided into three chapters and nine appendices.
            Within each chapter, methods for composing an observational
            scheme are presented first. A standard observation is presented
            next, and the remainder of each chapter is devoted to describing
            detailed methods for observing and recording a particular phenomenon.
            The appendices provide additional information without
            distracting from the main topics within the manual.</p>

          <h3>Units</h3>
          <p>The avalanche community within the United States typically uses
            a combination of English and International (SI) unit systems. In
            this document we have attempted to adhere to the SI system
            whenever possible. In the United States, personnel of avalanche
            operations and users of their products may not be familiar with
            all SI units. Individual programs should choose a unit system
            that suits their particular application. A recommended system
            of units, an alternative system of English units, and methods
            for converting values between the two systems are presented in
            <a href="/swag-content/5-2">Appendix B</a>. The most noticeable deviation from the SI system is
            the unit for elevation. In North America most topographic maps
            use feet as the unit for elevation. Therefore the recommended
            unit for elevation remains the foot. Throughout the document the
            recommended unit appears in the text with the common alternative
            unit adjacent in parentheses. Long-term data records should
            be stored in the recommended system of units in <a href="/swag-content/5-2">Appendix B</a>.
            Data records submitted to a central database are assumed to
            be in the recommended system unless otherwise stated in the
            accompanying metadata file (<a href="/swag-content/5-3">see Appendix C</a>).</p>

          <h3>Data Codes and Symbols</h3>
          <p>Symbols and data codes for many of the observations in this
            document appear in tables within each section. The use of these
            codes will save space in field books and on log sheets. Many of
            the codes in Chapter 1 follow conventions from the meteorological
            community. The codes in Chapters 2 and 3 were chosen to
            conform to common methods in the avalanche community and
            to promote efficient communication.</p>
